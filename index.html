      <h2>About Alan Turing</h2>
      <p>
        Alan Turing was a British mathematician and computer scientist who played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages during WWII. His work laid the foundations for computer science, developing concepts like the Turing Machine and contributing to artificial intelligence. Despite his vital contributions, he was prosecuted for homosexuality in 1952. In 2009, the UK government issued a formal apology, and he was posthumously pardoned in 2013.
