# Alan Turing Tribute

**A responsive tribute page dedicated to Alan Turing, the visionary mathematician and cryptanalyst whose groundbreaking work laid the foundation for modern computing and artificial intelligence.**
## 📌 Project Overview

**This project was developed as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. It serves as a tribute to Alan Turing, highlighting his pivotal contributions during World War II and his enduring legacy in the realm of computer science.**

## 🧠 About Alan Turing

**Alan Turing (1912–1954) was a British mathematician and logician who made significant contributions to the field of computer science. He is best known for his role in breaking the German Enigma code during World War II, which was instrumental in the Allied victory. Turing also developed the concept of the Turing machine, a fundamental model of computation, and proposed the Turing Test, a criterion of intelligence in machines. Despite his monumental achievements, Turing faced persecution for his homosexuality, a tragic aspect of his life that has since been acknowledged and rectified posthumously**
